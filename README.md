# arcade coin counter
just tried using event timers which i had studied alongside some module pattern of encapsulation in javascript object oriented programming using the IIfE  to test.This is my first project ever.you know how you put in coins to play games at the casino or arcade.NOT A GAME it is a coin counter.when coins finish it is game over
