# arcade coin counter
just tried using the module pattern of encapsulation and the IIfE(immediately invoked function expression) to test my understanding.This is my first project ever. you know how you put in coins to play games at the casino or arcade or coins in a vending machine .NOT A GAME,it is a coin counter.when coins finish, it is game over.
